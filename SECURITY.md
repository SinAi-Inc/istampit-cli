# 🔒 Security Policy

This document outlines which versions we support with security updates and how to responsibly report vulnerabilities.

## 📌 Supported Versions

The **iStampit CLI** follows semantic versioning.  
Only the latest **major release line** receives security updates.

| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Supported       |
| < 1.0   | ❌ Not supported   |

## 📢 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in iStampit (CLI, Action, or Website):

- **Email**: security@sinai.inc (PGP key available upon request)  
- **GitHub**: You may also use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/SinAi-Inc/istampit-cli/security/advisories/new) to report privately.  

Please include as much detail as possible:  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Potential impact  
- Suggested remediation (if known)  

### 🔄 What to Expect
- We will acknowledge receipt **within 48 hours**.  
- We will provide a status update **within 7 days**.  
- If confirmed, we will work on a fix and publish a new release as soon as possible.  
- Coordinated disclosure is appreciated: we prefer publishing fixes before public disclosure of vulnerabilities.
